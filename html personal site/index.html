        Extra meta data that helps searchs engine to show a descriptive little paragraph of what our page is about, 
        this could be used in every page we made for our own website. We should include a short description of what 
        it does/looks/provides to our users.
        Content: This is an attribute such as "name:" that contains the value of "name:", in other words, name is a 
        title, and content is the real content.

        Search engines:
        they crawl the HTML of your file, and look for certain meta tags in order to know what your website is about, 
        and also how to display it in the search index (main page). There are several attributes for the meta element which can be read on mdn webdocs

    <p>I am a programming student chasing his dream of developing the best webpages in the decade, combining knowledge from HTML, CSS, Java Script, SQL, Angular Framework, and Bootstrap to reach my goal. 
      Before dedicating my time to study coding, I used to be a Design student orientatated to web and product design. 
      I realized that my vocation wasn't focused on creating furniture nor products, but instead on using my creativity and imagination to convey something that was never seen before.
      Programmin has given me a different kind of tool, which I can exploit to desing and create my ideas and thoughts from 0. Before I discover coding, I was amazed from the quality and quantity of amazing possibilities that Graphic Design gave me, but I wasn't sure how to apply the knowledge i learned, in order to create something REAL, didactical, or extraordinary.
      After starting to learn it by myself, using as a helping hand CodeCademy, FreeCodeCamp, and Udemy, with the objective of complementing these new ways of working with code with my capabilities in Adobe "Illustrator", "Photoshop", and AutoDesk "Fusion 360", I realized how much potential could be found in web developing, and how much fun it could become. Combining Logical Thought with my capacity of creativity, my path got much more clearer than before, and made me get deeply involved in this type of learning.
      My plans for the future are to be able to keep learning about coding, reaching extents I would never had dreamed of, and wouldn't be possible for me if I hadn't accepted my own limitations as a Product Designer, and realizing my potential as a Web Designer and developer, or as I like to see it, a creator. I wouldn't be standing where I am today, so I am grateful of giving myself the chance of re-learning from the beggining. Today, I aspire to become a more complete programmer, acquiring knowledges from machine learning, AI, Linux, and Data Analysis, and take my projects to the next level.</p>
